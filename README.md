# 3D-FPS-Online-Multiplayer-Game
Recreated in Unity, meant to show my ability to follow along, recreate C# networking, and make a finished product.

I made this game (Fall 2017) primarily to demonstrate my base-level knowledge of server programming, particularly through Unity Networking.
In addition, as with any functional multiplayer game, I also  implement health systems, raycasting, and many other systems, that 
although are focused on game design, should demonstrate other more applicable skills.

I will not go through much detail about what each script does as the name is fairly self-explanitory, but I tried to add comments where
I thought the process got complex. 

For who want to play, the first person needs to host either locally or online, and the other players need to join the created room. To choose the appropriate option, click the buttons at the top left of the game window. Good luck.

**Known bugs:** You need to aim to the left of the enemy for the bullets to hit. The focus of the game was networking not GUI but I will fix this when I get the chance.
