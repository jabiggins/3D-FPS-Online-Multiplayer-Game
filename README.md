# 3D-FPS-Online-Multiplayer-Game
Recreated in Unity, meant to show my ability to follow along, recreate C# networking, and make a finished product.

I made this game (Fall 2017) primarily to demonstrate my base-level knowledge of server programming, particularly through Unity Networking.
In addition, as with any functional multiplayer game, I also  implement health systems, raycasting, and many other systems, that 
although are focused on game design, should demonstrate other more applicable skills.

I will not go through much detail about what each script does as the name is fairly self-explanitory, but I tried to add comments where
I thought the process got complex.
